Here we present a New Plugin which basically helps to arrange Seminar/Conference in an organized manner.

We provide a system that can handle the following:
        
* Multiple conferences


* Each conference can have multiple (max. 4) parallel tracks


* Each track can have multiple sessions


* Each session can have multiple speakers


* Special session type for breaks




== Description ==

                          
Conferences:
One of the important feature included in this plugin is separate Tabs for the individual dates of the Seminar/Conference.This is Responsive as well.
We have separate sections for different Tracks eg “Commercial Session” and “Residential Session”. The demarkation between the different types of session is done by separate colours for better clarity. The plugin has options for Parallel Tracks in the same time interval. Detailed Speaker Overview for all the speakers is also available.



Each Conference has:
        
*   Name         


*   Description         


*   Featured Image


*   Start-date and end-date


*   Name of location




Components of the Plugin:

Speakers

First we intend to add Speakers.
Each Speaker has:
        
* Fullname

* Phone (usage optional)

Widgets & Shortcodes
